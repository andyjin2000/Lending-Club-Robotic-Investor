# Lending Club Robotic Investor

In this project, we analyze data from Lending Club, which is a platform for peer-to-peer lending. 
Historically, factors that affect the risk of loans include the Lending Club Grade, the target ROI percentage, 
annual income of the person requesting the loan, and the purpose of the loan. 

A Robotic Investor is a program for automated investing; LendingRobot browses for potential new loan candidates and 
automatically invests a user's cash at his discretion. Benefits of a Robotic Investor include ease and transparency 
of usage, as well as its sophisticated ML-driven algorithms and fast speed.

The project objective is to develop a Robotic Investor, which, given a series of indicators about an individual's 
financial health, predicts his or her loan status. Specifically, we focus on terms of 36 months and seek to categorize 
the loan status as either Fully Paid or Charged Off. This is useful since it allows an investor to predict whether an 
individual will financially default, and hence whether or not the loan request should be approved.
